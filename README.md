# Merkle Tree

A hash tree or Merkle tree is a tree in which every "leaf" (node) is labelled with the cryptographic hash values of a data block, and every node that is not a leaf is labelled with the cryptographic hash of the labels of its child nodes. A hash tree allows efficient and secure verification of the contents of a large data structure.

The concept of the Hash tree is patented by [Ralph Merkle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Merkle) in 1979 and it is named after him.
